I. Situation:
  - The marketing team was considering launching a new advertising campaign to promote a recently developed product. 
  - The challenge was that the product was entirely new, and there was very little historical data available to make data-driven decisions. 
  - The team was divided on whether to proceed, given the high level of uncertainty.

II. Task:
  - Analyze the limited data we had, along with other relevant information, and provide a recommendation to the marketing team regarding whether to launch the campaign. 
  - The uncertainty lay in not knowing how the market would respond to the product and the campaign's potential ROI.

III. Action:
  - Data Gathering: I started by collecting all available data, even though it was limited. This included customer surveys, early product adoption rates, and any existing market research.
  - Market Research: I conducted additional market research to identify trends in the industry and the potential demand for similar products.
  - Scenario Analysis: Create multiple hypothetical scenarios for the campaign's success and failure. Assign probabilities to these scenarios based on the available information.
  - Cost-Benefit Analysis: Calculate potential costs of running the campaign, estimate the expected revenue from different scenarios, factoring in the probabilities -> assess the expected ROI under various circumstances.

IV. Result:
  - Create comprehensive report that outlined the potential outcomes of the campaign. 
  - Highlighted the level of uncertainty and the key assumptions made in the analysis. 
  - The marketing team decided to move forward with the campaign, considering it a calculated risk based on the analysis and the potential reward if the product gained traction in the market. 

In this case, they were willing to accept a level of uncertainty because they understood the rationale and assumptions behind the decision.

V. Reflection:
  - Be comfortable with uncertainty and to communicate it effectively to stakeholders. 
  - It also reinforced the importance of making decisions based on data, even when dealing with limited information. 
  - Scenario analysis and sensitivity testing were crucial tools in this process, helping the team understand the potential outcomes and risks associated with the decision.


Emphasize the value of thorough analysis and clear communication in addressing such challenges.
